Requirments of the project: 

Classification of Living Things
All living things can be classified as vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates can be further classified
into Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Boney Fishes, and Cartilaginous Fishes. Similarly,
invertebrates can be classified as Protostomes and Deuterostomes. Each one of these classes has
further subclasses and so on. In your project, you are required to implement this classification system.
You may consider LivingThings as the parent of all classes. When the system starts, it will have only
one item; LivingThings. A user may add Vertebrates and Invertebrates. The list keeps growing under
each one of these categories.
The system should provide the following features:
• Add a new class under any parent class
• Search for a particular class and show its complete hierarchy till LivingThings
• Delete any class
• View all items in your systems
• View all vertebrates
• View all invertebrates
• Clear list
For every class of living things, your system mus maintain:
• Class name
• Parent class
• Examples (animals belonging to the class)
